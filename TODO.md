# TODO - Language Detection Project

## High Priority

### 1. Fix Test Issues
- [ ] Fix Italian language detection test (currently detected as Portuguese)
- [ ] Update example test to match new output format
- [ ] Add more comprehensive test cases for edge cases

### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- [ ] Add proper error handling for null pointers in Rust
- [ ] Implement error types in Go for better error handling
- [ ] Add validation for empty strings and very short text

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Add benchmark tests to measure performance
- [ ] Implement detector instance pooling for concurrent access
- [ ] Optimize memory allocation/deallocation patterns

## Medium Priority

### 4. API Enhancements
- [ ] Add function to get all supported languages
- [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple texts
- [ ] Add configuration options (min confidence, max results)
- [ ] Add function to get top N language candidates

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Add API documentation with examples
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks documentation
- [ ] Add deployment guide for different platforms

### 6. Testing Improvements
- [ ] Add integration tests with real-world text samples
- [ ] Add stress tests for concurrent access
- [ ] Add tests for memory leak scenarios
- [ ] Add tests for different text lengths and complexities

## Low Priority

### 7. Additional Features
- [ ] Add support for more languages (check Lingua's full list)
- [ ] Implement language detection confidence thresholds
- [ ] Add support for script detection (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.)
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequently detected texts

### 8. Build System Improvements
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add cross-platform build support
- [ ] Add Docker containerization
- [ ] Add automated testing in CI

### 9. Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Add structured logging
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Add monitoring for memory usage

## Future Enhancements

### 10. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement language detection with context
- [ ] Add support for code-switching detection
- [ ] Add language family detection
- [ ] Implement custom language models

### 11. Integration Examples
- [ ] Create HTTP server example
- [ ] Add gRPC service example
- [ ] Create CLI tool with various options
- [ ] Add web interface example

### 12. Research and Analysis
- [ ] Compare performance with other language detection libraries
- [ ] Analyze accuracy improvements with different text lengths
- [ ] Research optimal confidence thresholds for different use cases
- [ ] Study the impact of mixed-language text on accuracy

## Completed Tasks

### âœ… Initial Setup
- [x] Set up Rust FFI with Lingua
- [x] Create Go CGO interface
- [x] Implement basic language detection
- [x] Add SEA language support
- [x] Add mixed language tests
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation
- [x] Set up build system with Makefile
- [x] Add cbindgen configuration
- [x] Create development artifacts for Cursor

## Notes

### Current Limitations
- Short text detection can be ambiguous
- Some language pairs are easily confused (e.g., Italian/Portuguese)
- CGO calls have performance overhead
- Memory management requires careful attention

### Technical Debt
- Error handling could be more robust
- Tests could be more comprehensive
- Documentation could include more examples
- Build process could be more automated

### Performance Considerations
- CGO overhead for each function call
- Large library size due to language models
- Memory allocation for each detection
- No caching of detector instances

This TODO list should guide future development and help prioritize improvements to the language detection system.
